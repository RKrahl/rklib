History of changes to rklib
===========================

0.1.dev (not yet released)
    + Initial release.  The modules in this package have been taken
      from other packages.  Some of them I have written for my job at
      Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f√ºr Materialien und Energie (HZB),
      others stem from private projects of mine:

      - :mod:`rklib.filelock`: a first version of this code has been
	written for an internal project at HZB in February 2015.  A
	later version has been reused in `tiny-init`_ in July 2018.

      - :mod:`rklib.units`: the classes in this module have first been
	written for `icat-server-test`_ in January 2017.
